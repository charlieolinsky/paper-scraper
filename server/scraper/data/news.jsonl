{"paragraph": "Id Software is keeping busy as the company unveiled the next installment in the Doom franchise, subtitled The Dark Ages.  As a previous  Insider Gaming  report noted, Doom: The Dark Ages is a prequel that includes a dark fantasy with  a medieval-inspired theme . It launches 2025 on Xbox Series X and S, PC, and PlayStation 5, continuing Microsoft's recent multi-platform push for Xbox games. This was the description posted in Xbox Wire. The prequel to  Doom  (2016), Doom: The Dark Ages puts players behind the visor of the mighty Slayer as they battle demonic hordes in grounded, hard-hitting combat inside an epic, cinematic tale of gods, kings and monsters. Supplementing his superhuman skills and over-the-top arsenal, the Slayer will also call upon his colossal Atlan mech to brawl with titanic beasts and retake the skies aboard his ferocious steed: a jet-fueled, cybernetic war dragon. There had been rumors dating back to  a leaked Microsoft court document  published in 2023 that claimed that a new Doom game was in development back when it was previously known under the name Doom: Year Zero. Yet today's announcement is the first time id Software and Microsoft are properly revealing the project after an  \"IDKFA\" trademark  filing was spotted last month, in addition to the report mentioned above.  This is the next entry in id Software's long-running first-person shooter franchise, following the release of Doom Eternal in 2020 and its two DLC expansions, The Ancient Gods Part One and Part Two, released in 2020 and 2021, respectively.  In  our review of Doom Eternal , my colleague Ryan McCaffrey wrote: \"Whether you're a new Doom fan or a veteran one, Doom Eternal is bound to delight & entertain you. It's gloriously fun.\" For more, check out  everything announced at the Xbox Games Showcase 2024 . Taylor is a Reporter at IGN. You can follow her on Twitter  @TayNixster."}
