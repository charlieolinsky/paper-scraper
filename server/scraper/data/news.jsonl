Fallout 5 could be a very long ways off indeed While  Fallout  5  has yet to be officially revealed, we do know that it is being worked on in some respect, and that it'll follow Bethesda's next RPG.

Read on to learn everything we know about  Fallout 5 . If you've ever played a Fallout game, you'll know the series revels in its nuclear-ravaged American setting. Fallout games have all been set in a US state, so it would stand to reason this aspect wouldn't change.  Fallout 3 , for example, was set in Washington while  Fallout 4  took place in Boston. In fact, Todd Howard recently commented on Fallout's American setting in an  interview with Kinda Funny . In it, he explains that the series' main themes are inherently tied to America: \"My view is part of the Fallout schtick is on the Americana naivete. And so, you know, it's okay to acknowledge some of those other areas but our plan is to predominantly keep it in the US\" For those looking for a different experience, however, modders have been  hard at work crafting their own takes  on other locations in the Fallout universe. You don't have to look far to see fans discussing and fantasizing about where  Fallout 5  will take place.  Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It is possible that a new Fallout game could be set in New Orleans given that a trademark application for ' Fallout New Orleans ' was spotted online way back in 2016.  We've already visited swampy areas in Fallout, but a game set entirely around the deep South would certainly be an interesting take, especially given New Orleans' distinctive urban environments. Todd Howard isn't putting a date on Fallout 5 anytime soon \nIn an  interview with IGN , Todd Howard revealed that he is avoiding putting even a rough date on Fallout 5. He confirmed that the team is currently working on  Elder Scrolls  6, but added that this 'doesn't mean that we're not making plans for other things.' Fallout TV show is \"almost like Fallout 5\" \n Speaking to Total Film (via  Gamesradar ), Fallout TV director Jonathan Nolan described the series as \"almost like Fallout 5\". Fallout 5  is coming after  The Elder Scrolls 6 \n In an interview with  IGN , Todd Howard confirmed that  Fallout 5  will be Bethesda's next major project after  The Elder Scrolls 6 . \"Yes, Elder Scrolls 6 is in pre-production and, you know, we’re going to be doing Fallout 5 after that, so our slate’s pretty full going forward for a while\" Howard told the publication. \"We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well.\" Work has begun...sort of \n Work has started on  Fallout 5  but don’t hold your breath for seeing it any time soon. Speaking to  IGN  in November 2021 ,  regarding the impending release of  The Elder Scrolls 5:  Skyrim  Anniversary Edition , Bethesda studio director Todd Howard revealed that a “one-pager” design document was already in place for  Fallout 5 , being a very early blueprint for what the studio has planned for the game.  Being a “one-pager”, the design document is a high-level outline and there is, therefore, little to share. With   Starfield   and  The Elder Scrolls 6  both up first, it’ll be a while before we hear more about  Fallout 5 .  As for whether or not Obsidian—the studio which handled development duties on the Xbox 360-era  Fallout: New Vegas —could have some involvement, Howard said \"We've worked with other people from time to time. I can't say what's gonna happen...If I could wave my hand and have [ Fallout 5 ] out...you know, I'd like to find a way to accelerate what we do, but I can't really say today or commit to anything... other than [the fact that] our cadence is  Starfield  then  Elder Scrolls 6 \".  Cat Bussell is a Staff Writer at TechRadar Gaming.
