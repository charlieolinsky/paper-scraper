Setting Up Conda/Python Environment

1. Install Miniconda 
    This will allow you to use the conda package manager and conda virtual environments.

2. Duplicate Conda Environment from environment.yml 
    this will give you all required dependencies and the correct Python version.
    
    $  conda env create -f environment.yml

3. Activate Conda Environment:
    
    $ conda activate paperscraper

Important Notes

1.  Installing New Dependencies:
        If you install any new dependencies, ensure you update the environment.yml file in the root directory (/server). 
        After your work is done, always run:

        $ conda env export > environment.yml

2.  Updating the Environment:
        If there is an existing environment.yml file and you want to update your environment with the latest dependencies from the file, run:

        $ conda env update -f environment.yml

3.  Pushing Changes to GitHub:
        Only push changes to GitHub after updating the environment.yml file to ensure that all team members have the latest environment configuration.


By following these steps, you can ensure that the conda environment is consistent and up-to-date across the entire team.
