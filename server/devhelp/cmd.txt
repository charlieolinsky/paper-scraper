NOTE: /server/scraper is the root directory for all scraper commands.

Create a new scrapy project:
$ scrapy startproject <project-name>

Run a webscraper by name:
$ scrapy crawl <crawler-name>

Open the scrapy shell to test commands / selectors:
$ scrapy shell "<url>"
NOTE: exit scrapy shell with 'quit()'

Storing scraped data to a file:
$ scrapy crawl <crawler-name> -O ./data/fileName.jsonl
NOTE: -O overwrites an existing file; use -o instead to append new content
